## Notes

- Font size is controlled via `className` (e.g. `text-7xl`), making the component fully composable.
- Each character is animated independently with staggered timing for a cinematic reveal.
- Three colored slice layers (top, middle, bottom) sweep across each character during the reveal.
- The component extends standard `div` props — you can pass any HTML div attribute.
- Works with both light and dark themes out of the box.
