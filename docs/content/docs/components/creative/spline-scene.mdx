## API Reference

### SplineScene

The main component for rendering Spline 3D scenes with lazy loading and suspense.

<AutoTypeTable
  path="./types/docs/spline-scene.ts"
  name="SplineSceneProps"
/>

## Features

- **Lazy Loading**: Component is lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size
- **Suspense Fallback**: Built-in loading spinner while scene loads
- **Fully Interactive**: All Spline interactions work out of the box
- **Responsive**: Adapts to container size with className support
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces

## Performance Tips

- The Spline library is loaded only when the component is used
- Consider using loading="lazy" for scenes below the fold
- Optimize your Spline scenes for web (reduce complexity and file size)
- Use the loading fallback to improve perceived performance

## Browser Support

Spline scenes require WebGL support and work best on:
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers with WebGL support

## Notes

- The component uses React Suspense for code splitting
- First render includes a loading spinner that matches your theme
- Scene interactions (clicks, hovers) are handled by Spline automatically
- Make sure to set explicit height on the container for proper display
